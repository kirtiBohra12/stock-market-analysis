This Project highlights the unique insights gained from an in-depth analysis of historical data from the Nifty 500 firms. The dataset was obtained from Kaggle, and a link to it is provided below for reference. The complete data cleaning procedure was carried out in the Jupyter Notebook environment using the Python programming language. Following that, Power BI expertly handled the visualisation element, enabling for the extraction of essential insights to solve specific problem statements. More information, including a description of the dataset and details on the related files, is provided below.
